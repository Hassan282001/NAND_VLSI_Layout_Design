This project contains transistor-level Cadence Virtuoso layouts for a CMOS inverter and a two-input NAND gate, along with all the files needed to verify and extract them:

- **Layout design** of NMOS/PMOS devices, routing, and contacts  
- **DRC decks & reports** to ensure the geometry meets foundry rules  
- **LVS decks & logs** to confirm the drawn layout matches the schematic netlist  
- **AV_extracted views** (parasitic-aware netlists) for post-layout simulation and timing/power analysis
